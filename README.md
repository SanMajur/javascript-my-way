Learning new things is always a challenge for anyone especially with a lot of resources on the internet. This repository is about my journey in learning and leveling up my JavaScript (JS) skill set. I have always found it hard to commit to learning JS and understanding the fundamental concepts of the language because of luck of accountability and documentation of my progress.
