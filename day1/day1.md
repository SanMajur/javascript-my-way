# Day one
The first day of my attempt of the [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) got me searching for the resources to accomplish the challenge and I landed on the following based on my preference.
## Resources (Books, Websites, courses)
I have used different JavaScript resources from ebooks, youtube videos, and online courses to try and understand the foundamental concepts from different perspectives, and made my own conclusions based on my understanding. Mentioned below are some of the resources I have used:-

### Editors

My editor of choice was and still is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I had considered using [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.en.softonic.com/) but after some research, VS code caught my attention because of various Extentions and it was visual appealing. I have downloaded the following extentions to help increase my productivity:-

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
